This directory will contain the audio narration files for each chapter.

Expected files:

- scene1_3.mp3 - Chapter 1, Stage 3 narration
- scene2_1.mp3 - Chapter 2, Stage 1 narration

Note: Audio files should be optimized for web delivery (compressed, appropriate bitrate)
Voice should be clear, engaging, and appropriate for middle/high school students.
